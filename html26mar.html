                <strong>Bear:</strong> Bears are large mammals found in various habitats worldwide. They are known for their powerful build, thick fur, and plantigrade posture (walking on the soles of their feet). Bears are omnivorous, with a diet ranging from berries and insects to fish and other animals. They are generally solitary animals, except during mating season or when mothers are with their cubs. Many bear species hibernate during the winter, entering a state of dormancy to conserve energy.
